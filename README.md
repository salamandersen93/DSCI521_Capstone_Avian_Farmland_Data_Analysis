<h2> Correlation, Linear Regression, and Network Analysis of Ornithological Citizen Science Data and USDA Agricultural Census Data: Grassland Bird Species</h2>

<h3> Background: </h3> Grassland bird species have sufferred a staggering 40% decline in population since 1966 due to a combination of habitat loss from climate change and conversion of native prairie grasslands to agricultural land. Understanding the population dynamics of these species and how they respond to changes in agricultural practice and methodologies could be a critical step in refining conservation efforts and a brighter future for species of critical concern.

The dataset in this project was constructed as part of a Udacity Data Engineering nanodegree using python and postgreSQL. This analysis (DSCI 521 project) is a continuation of that work, and will leverage a set of techniques including correlation analysis, linear regression, and network analysis to drill into the data. The intention of this analysis is to bring to light trends which could be used to inform conservation actions by policymakers and agricultural organizations. For example, could decreasing treatment of cropland with pesticides in a given county help a given species rebound? Could incentivizing conversion of cropland to pastureland result in increased populations of a given species of critical conservation concern?
